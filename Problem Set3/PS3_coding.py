# d.
# The original image is in RGB-256 format. Each pixel requires (log2 256) Ã— 3 = 24 bits of memory to store.
# The compressed image only has 16 colors, therefore each pixel only requires log2 16 = 4 bits of memory. The overall compression factor is 24 / 4 = 6, which is a fairly large amount. As can be seen from the images above, the compression process using k-means only results in minimal loss of detail in this example.
